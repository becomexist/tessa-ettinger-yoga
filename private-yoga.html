		<p>Private Yoga lessons are a great way to get individualised yoga tuition to meet your unique needs, as different cues, modifications and movements are often required for different body types and conditions.</p>

		<p>Group classes can sometimes feel overwhelming or underwhelming depending on where you’re at.  One to one yoga sessions can help you overcome barriers to either enter the world of yoga or deepen your current practice.</p>

		<p>They are also helpful to give personalised adjustments for correct and safe alignment that often aren’t possible in a studio with many bodies and one set of teaching hands, especially if you are dealing with an injury.</p>

		<p>Also, for those who have a busy or irregular schedule it can be hard to find a public yoga class that works, in which case private yoga lessons can be the perfect solution.</p>

		<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
	
		<p>Before you commit, we can have a chat either on the phone or in person to discuss your specific needs and what you want to get out of the lesson.</p>
		
		<p>Each session will usually involve some sun salutations, standing sequences, seated postures and then restorative poses to close, before a final savasana (rest).  It may also include some training in breathing techniques (pranayama) or work around preparing for a specific posture.  We can either follow the set sequences from Ashtanga (Primary Series) or Rocket yoga, or create something more bespoke and varied.</p>
	
		<p>Lessons can be 60, 75 or 90 minutes.  It can be a one-off, ad-hoc, or a regular thing.  It really is all dependent on you.  If you are not sure what you want or need, I will happily make some suggestions and we can tweak as we go along.</p>
