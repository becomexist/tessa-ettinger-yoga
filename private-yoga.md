  Private Yoga lessons are a great way to get individualised yoga tuition to meet your unique needs as different cues, modifications and movements are often required for different body types and conditions.

  Group classes can sometimes feel overwhelming or underwhelming depending on where you’re at. One to one yoga sessions can help you overcome barriers to either enter the world of yoga or deepen your current practice.

  They are also helpful to give personalised adjustments for correct and safe alignment that often aren’t possible in a busy class, especially if you are dealing with an injury. For those who have hectic or irregular schedules it can be hard to find a timetabled class that suits, in which case private lessons can be the perfect solution.
secondary_text: "## How Does it Work?\n\t\nBefore you commit, you can have an initial
  chat with Tessa to discuss your specific needs and what you want to get out of the
  lesson.\n\t\t\nEach session will usually involve some sun salutations, standing
  sequences, seated postures and restorative poses, before a final savasana (rest).
  It may also include some training in breathing techniques (pranayama) or work around
  preparing for a specific posture. You can choose to follow the set sequences from
  Ashtanga (Primary Series) or Rocket yoga, or opt for something more bespoke and
  varied.\n\t\nA lesson can be 60, 75 or 90 minutes.  It can be one-off, ad-hoc, or
  regular.  It really is all dependent on you.  If you are unsure what you want or
  need, Tessa will happily make some suggestions and together you can tweak as you
  go along."
