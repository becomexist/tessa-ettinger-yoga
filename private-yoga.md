		<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
	
		<p>Before you commit, you can have an initial chat with Tessa to discuss your specific needs and what you want to get out of the lesson.</p>
		
		<p>Each session will usually involve some sun salutations, standing sequences, seated postures and restorative poses, before a final savasana (rest). It may also include some training in breathing techniques (pranayama) or work around preparing for a specific posture. You can choose to follow the set sequences from Ashtanga (Primary Series) or Rocket yoga, or opt for something more bespoke and varied.</p>
	
		<p>A lesson can be 60, 75 or 90 minutes.  It can be one-off, ad-hoc, or regular.  It really is all dependent on you.  If you are unsure what you want or need, Tessa will happily make some suggestions and together you can tweak as you go along.</p>
