> The Goal of Yoga (No, it's not the Handstand)
 
> The yoga pose is not the goal. Becoming flexible is not the goal. Standing on your hands is not the goal.  

> The goal is to create space where you were once stuck. To unveil the layers of protection you've built around your heart. To appreciate your body and become aware of the mind and the noise it creates. To make peace with who you are. The goal is to love, well ... You.  

> Come to your yoga mat to feel; not accomplish. Shift your focus and your heart will grow.

It is easy to get caught up with focusing on the physical postures when practicing yoga.  We are surrounded by a culture that equates certain aesthetic qualities and high-achievement with worth, and are bombarded by images and media portraying these messages daily.  It can feel quite intimidating in this age of social media to be surrounded by images of people perfectly executing difficult yoga postures.  The handstand in its various forms seems to have become the holy grail of pictures posted on various platforms by those who can.  The desire to master it, amongst other impressive looking yoga poses, can become almost obsessive in many of us yoga practitioners.  I am certainly not exempt from getting caught up in this mindset, however when success and attainment become the focus, the practice of yoga can become exhausting, shallow and even demoralising.  Progress in this way can feel slow or non-existent and injuries may occur as the body is pushed too far.  This is when our ego or mind is running the show and the body neglected, rather than felt and listened to.  It can take us away from ourselves and the potential that our yoga practice holds for us.

However, we are each unique and going through a vast array of differing life experiences.  Being told by some external source or seemingly higher yogic authority what we should be focusing on doesn’t feel appropriate when this is considered.  It runs the risk of feeling preachy, judgmental or belittling.  In which case, it is probably best for each of us to figure out and decide what the goal of yoga is for us.

Wherever we’re at in our practice, is part of our journey in yoga and funnily enough, also in life.  Maybe we need a phase of focusing on the physical, as it will teach us what we need to learn to get to the next stage of our practice.  With the right input, guidance or support, it is possible have many insights whatever our focus is in yoga at any time and these are likely to be different for each individual practitioner.  For example, we may learn about the way we treat our bodies and hence ourselves, or more simply that we love to be upside down.  In this way, our yoga practice becomes more fluid and free, with no set goal, but an evolving journey of discovery into learning about our bodies and therefore ourselves.

In this way, we can develop a spiritual practice with our yoga.  As the author stated in the original extract written above, this can help us build or maintain a healthy relationship with ourselves, creating or working towards more self-love.  Yet the act of ‘making peace’ with who we are or ultimately of ‘loving ourselves’, whilst appearing so simple on paper, can often feel more elusive than achieving the famed handstand.  It is no wonder then, that we get so focused on the physical and so in some cases, maybe the handstand is a good place to start.
