main_heading: About Tessa
intro_text: Tessa believes in making yoga accessible to anybody who is interested.  
  She is passionate about using yoga as a tool to help support physical and mental 
  wellbeing, and better understand our body, mind and soul.  She is enthusiastic about 
  facilitating this within her students and assisting them in nurturing a compassionate 
  body-mind connection.
secondary_text: Tessa has been practicing yoga for many years. She previously became 
  immersed in the Ashtanga system of yoga and has practiced this dynamic style 
  extensively.  She found over time that her yoga practice needed to adjust to the 
  natural ebb and flow of life and respond to her ever-changing physical and emotional 
  needs.  She now practices yoga in a more fluid way, drawing from different styles, so 
  that it can be tailored to these fluctuations.  She enjoys using this approach to 
  assist others in finding or deepening their personal yoga practice and approach.
  <br><br>
  Tessa completed her 200hr teacher training in Ashtanga Vinyasa and Rocket yoga in 
  June 2014 and has since undertaken further advanced trainings in Yin & Yang yoga, 
  Restorative yoga, practical anatomy & adjustments and yoga for addictions.  This has 
  equipped her to teach both dynamic and restorative classes.
  <br><br>
  She has experience teaching in a variety of settings including gyms, studios and 
  offices, as well as recovering addicts in prison. She teaches several public yoga 
  classes in various Virgin Active gyms around London, where she additionally teaches 
  AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial yoga and fitness.
  <br><br>
  She is also a qualified counsellor, which has given her the skills to be able to hold 
  and support any emotional material that may be present.  It is important to Tessa that 
  she creates a nurturing and therapeutic space where people feel safe to be themselves.
