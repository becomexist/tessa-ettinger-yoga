main_heading: About Tessa
intro_text: Tessa is a North Londoner and has been practicing yoga for many years.
  She has become particularly drawn to Ashtanga yoga and has learnt to adapt this
  dynamic practice depending on her emotional and physical condition.  She approaches
  it in a non-traditional way, so that it can be tailored to her changing needs and
  be nurturing while remaining challenging.  She is passionate about using this approach
  to assist others in finding or deepening their personal yoga practice and approach.

  Tessa completed her 200hr teacher training in **Ashtanga Vinyasa** and **Rocket yoga** in June 2014 and has since undertaken further advanced trainings in Yin & Yang yoga, practical anatomy & adjustments, yoga for addictions and from April 2017 Mandala Vinyasa.  This equips her to teach the more energetic styles of Ashtanga, Vinyasa and Rocket yoga, together with some restorative postures.

  She has experience teaching in a variety of settings including offices, prison, studios and gyms. She teaches several public yoga classes in various Virgin Active gyms around London, where she additionally teaches AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial yoga and fitness. She particularly enjoys teaching private yoga lessons of all levels in Crouch End, North London.
