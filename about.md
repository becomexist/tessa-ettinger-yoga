main_heading: About Tessa
intro_text: Tessa is a North Londoner and has been practicing yoga for many years.
  She has been particularly drawn to Ashtanga yoga and has learnt to adapt this dynamic
  practice to her changing needs.  She approaches it in a non-traditional way, so
  that it can be tailored to her emotional and physical condition, allowing it to
  both nurture and challenge.  She is passionate about using this approach to assist
  others in finding or deepening their personal yoga practice and approach.
secondary_text: "Tessa completed her 200hr teacher training in Ashtanga Vinyasa and
  Rocket yoga in June 2014 and has since undertaken further advanced trainings in
  Yin & Yang yoga, practical anatomy & adjustments and yoga for addictions.  This
  equips her to teach the more energetic styles of Ashtanga, Vinyasa and Rocket yoga,
  together with some restorative postures.\n\nShe has experience teaching in a variety
  of settings including offices, studios, gyms and in a prison. She teaches several
  public yoga classes in various Virgin Active gyms around London, where she additionally
  teaches AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial yoga and fitness. \n\nShe is also in
  the final year of a counselling training which has helped her develop a strong sense
  of the interconnectedness of body, mind and feelings. She has discovered that increasing
  awareness in our bodies responses can help bring us back to our authentic connection
  with ourselves, not just physically, but mentally, emotionally and spiritually.
  Tessa believes yoga is an excellent tool for this and will often incorporate it
  in her private yoga sessions."
