main_heading: About Tessa
intro_text: Tessa completed her 200hr teacher training in Ashtanga Vinyasa and Rocket
  yoga with The Yoga People in June 2014 and has since undertaken further advanced
  trainings in Yin & Yang yoga, practical anatomy & adjustments and yoga for addictions.  This
  has equipped her to teach both energetic and restorative classes based around the
  Ashtanga Vinyasa system of yoga.
secondary_text: "She has experience teaching in a variety of settings including offices,
  studios and gyms, as well as recovering addicts in prison. She teaches several public
  yoga classes in various Virgin Active gyms around London, where she additionally
  teaches AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial yoga and fitness. \n\n\nShe is also in
  the final year of a counselling training which together with her yoga practice,
  has brought greater recognition of the mental and not just physical benefits of
  yoga.  She has discovered that through mindful practice we become more connected
  to our bodies, which can gently bring greater connection to our minds and ultimately
  to ourselves.  She therefore holds this awareness throughout her teaching by creating
  a nurturing and therapeutic space."
