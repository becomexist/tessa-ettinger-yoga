main_heading: About Tessa
intro_text: Tessa believes in making yoga accessible to anybody who is interested.  She
  is passionate about using yoga as a tool to help bring greater physical and mental
  freedom, and better understand our body, mind and soul.  She is enthusiastic about
  facilitating this within her students and assisting them in nurturing a compassionate
  body-mind connection.
secondary_text: "Tessa has been practicing yoga for many years. She previously became
  immersed in the Ashtanga system of yoga and has practiced this dynamic style extensively.
  \ She found over time that she needed to adjust this yoga practice to the natural
  ebb and flow of life and respond to her ever-changing physical and emotional needs.
  \ She now practices yoga in a more fluid way, drawing from different styles, so
  that it can be tailored to these changing tides - she enjoys using this approach
  to assist others in finding or deepening their personal yoga practice and approach.\n\nTessa
  completed her 200hr teacher training in Ashtanga Vinyasa and Rocket yoga in June
  2014 and has since undertaken further advanced trainings in Yin & Yang yoga, Restorative
  yoga, practical anatomy & adjustments and yoga for addictions.  This has equipped
  her to teach both dynamic and restorative classes.\n\nShe has experience teaching
  in a variety of settings including gyms, studios and offices, as well as recovering
  addicts in prison. She teaches several public yoga classes in various Virgin Active
  gyms around London, where she additionally teaches AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial
  yoga and fitness. \n\nShe is also a qualified counsellor, which has given her the
  skills to be able to hold and support any emotional material that may be present.
  \ It is important to Tessa that she creates a nurturing and therapeutic space where
  people feel safe to be themselves.\n"
