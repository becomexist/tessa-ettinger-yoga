main_heading: About Tessa
intro_text: Tessa completed her 200hr teacher training in Ashtanga Vinyasa and Rocket
  yoga in June 2014 and has since undertaken further advanced trainings in Yin & Yang
  yoga, practical anatomy & adjustments and yoga for addictions.  This equips her
  to teach the more energetic styles of Ashtanga, Vinyasa and Rocket yoga, together
  with some restorative postures.
secondary_text: "She has experience teaching in a variety of settings including offices,
  studios and gyms, as well as recovering addicts in prison. She teaches several public
  yoga classes in various Virgin Active gyms around London, where she additionally
  teaches AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial yoga and fitness. \n\nShe is also in
  the final year of a counselling training which together with her yoga practice,
  has brought greater recognition of the mental, along with physical, benefits of
  yoga.  She has discovered that increasing awareness in our bodies responses can
  help bring us back to our authentic connection with ourselves.  She is therefore
  mindful of the potential for various emotions to arise through yoga practice and
  is able to hold these in a nurturing and therapeutic way."
