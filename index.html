<p>There are a myriad of reasons why you may want yoga to be possible for you.  The list is endless and very personal to each practitioner.</p>

<p>If yoga is already a part of your life, this may seem obvious and the ‘why’ very clear.  But maybe it isn’t and you’re feeling a pull towards it anyway.  Either way, yoga can help you increase fitness, strength, flexibility, agility and maintain the health of your body.  You could be rehabilitating an injury.  Or maybe you want to connect to your body or yourself in a different way, to create a sense of calm in your life, or do something nurturing for you.  You could be drawn to the impressive postures and have a desire to achieve a particular one (or some) and in the process, realise that what previously felt impossible is possible, or to your surprise learn some deeper lesson instead!
</p>

<p>All of this and more is possible through yoga, depending on the unique set of traits and circumstances that each one of you brings.  And the good news is, that there’s no right or wrong!  Private Yoga lessons are a great way to get individualised yoga tuition to meet your unique needs.</p>
