		<h1>About Tessa</h1>
		<p>Tessa is a North Londoner and has been practicing yoga for many years. She has become particularly drawn to Ashtanga yoga and has learnt to adapt this dynamic practice depending on her emotional and physical condition.  She approaches it in a non-traditional way, so that it can be tailored to her changing needs and be nurturing while remaining challenging.  She is passionate about using this approach to assist others in finding or deepening their personal yoga practice and approach.</p>
