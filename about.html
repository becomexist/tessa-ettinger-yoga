		<h1>About Tessa</h1>
		<p>Tessa is a North Londoner, born-and-bred and Ashtanga Yoga practiotiner of many years. Immersing herself in this style, she has learnt to adapt the practice depending on different moods and physical conditions.  She now approaches this dynamic and traditionally 'rigid' form of yoga in a non-traditional way, so that it can be tailored to different needs and be nurturing yet challenging.  She is passionate about using this approach to assist others in finding or deepening their personal yoga practice and approach.</p>

<p>Tessa completed her 200hr teacher training in <strong>Ashtanga Vinyasa</strong> and <strong>Rocket Yoga</strong> in June 2014 and has since undertaken further advanced trainings in Yin & Yang yoga, Practical anatomy & adjustments, yoga for addictions and soon, Mandala Vinyasa.  This equips her to teach the more energetic styles of Ashtanga, Vinyasa and Rocket yoga, whilst also including some more restorative postures.  She particularly enjoys teaching beginners and intermediates in private yoga lessons in Crouch End, North London.  She also teaches several public yoga classes in various Virgin Active gyms around London, where she additionally teaches AntiGravity Yoga, a form of aerial yoga and fitness.</p>
