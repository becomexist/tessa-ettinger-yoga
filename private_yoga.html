	<p>Private Yoga lessons are a great way to get individualised yoga tuition to meet your unique needs, as different cues, modifications and movements are often required for different body types and conditions.  Group classes can sometimes feel overwhelming or underwhelming depending on where you’re at and one to one yoga sessions can help you overcome barriers to either enter the world of yoga or deepen your current practice.  They are also helpful to give personalised adjustments for correct and safe alignment that often aren’t possible in a studio with many bodies and one set of teaching hands, especially if you are dealing with an injury.  Also, for those who have a busy or irregular schedule it can be hard to find a public yoga class that works, in which case private yoga lessons can be the perfect solution.</p>
